## 🚀 What is VulnHunter Pro?

**VulnHunter Pro** is an all-in-one vulnerability scanner designed to automate common web pentesting tasks and detect security flaws in modern web applications. It combines several techniques and tools into a single, high-performance CLI scanner.

It supports detection of:
- ✅ SQL Injection (SQLi)
- ✅ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- ✅ Insecure security headers
- ✅ Directory and file disclosure
- ✅ Misconfigured cookies
- ✅ Weak SSL/TLS setups

Reports are generated in visual (HTML) and structured (JSON) formats, with actionable remediation tips.

🛠 Customize Rules
You can add your own detection rules by editing rules.py:

CUSTOM_RULES = [
    {
        "name": "Custom Admin Rule",
        "pattern": r"admin\s*=\s*true",

    }
]

You can also extend or replace wordlists in /wordlists.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

Dependency issues:

pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
Timeouts or blocked requests:

Make sure the target is reachable and not behind strict WAF rules.

Use --stealth mode or proxy through Burp/ZAP.

No vulnerabilities detected?

Test against known vulnerable apps like:

https://testphp.vulnweb.com
